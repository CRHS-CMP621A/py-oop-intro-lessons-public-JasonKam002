    "### What is an object?\n",
    "Objects are used to model things in code. An object can represent a physical \n",
    "item, e.g. an LED; or a digital unit, e.g. a bank account or an enemy in a\n",
    "computer game. As such, an object is basically a group of data and functions.\n",
    "Because you can define your own objects, you can represent anything you like\n",
    "using an object!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would we want to make an object?\n",
    "One of the benefits of using object-oriented programming is that unnecessary\n",
    "details can be abstracted away in the implementation of the methods. We do\n",
    "not need to know the specifics of exactly how a method works to be able to\n",
    "use it, we simply need to know that when we call the method, we will achieve\n",
    "a desired outcome.\n",
